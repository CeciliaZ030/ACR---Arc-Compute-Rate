"""A document may not name a host beside a route that host does not serve.

THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR, measured 2026-10-12 with `make verify-drift`:

    acr-probe-free    mainnet 5042      50 of 50 served
    acr-api-1fto      testnet 5042002   50 of 50 served
    acr-api-mainnet   mainnet 5042      44 of 50  <- 404s /par and all /operator/*

and `docs/acr-openapi.md` — the repo's only endpoint reference, linked from
`docs/README.md` as "the seller API, endpoint by endpoint" — named
`acr-api-mainnet` as its live spec and catalog, then listed all six routes that
host answers 404 for. A stranger following our own documentation to the one
surface they can exercise without a key got a 404.

WHY THE EXISTING GATES COULD NOT SEE IT. `gen_openapi_doc.py --check` compares
the document to `app.openapi()` — the LOCAL route table — so a doc generated
from this checkout and labelled with a host that serves six fewer routes matches
perfectly. `verify_deploy_drift.py` does ask the hosts, and it is a manual
`make verify-drift` that is not in CI. Neither was wrong; they were answering a
different question, and nobody was asking this one.

This gate is hermetic on purpose, so it runs in CI with no network: the
incomplete host and what it lacks are recorded below as measurements, and the
check is that no document presents that host as somewhere to send a request
without saying so. When the image is rebuilt, delete the entry and the gate
relaxes by itself.
