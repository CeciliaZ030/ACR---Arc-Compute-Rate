"""Generate the pivot diagram (excalidraw): the index demoted to a feature.

    uv run python scripts/gen_pivot_diagram.py
    uv run python scripts/gen_pivot_diagram.py --check   # build, validate, write nothing

ONE ARGUMENT, DRAWN. The index is what this project leads with, and it is the
weakest thing it owns: `anchors/GAP.md` records its own reference levels sitting
20x to 1159x away from real market prices, the published tape is `sim`, and every
payer so far is ours. The spend operator needs none of that to be useful. So in
this picture the benchmark is a small box wired into ONE gate of eight, and the
money path is the subject.

Reuses `gen_architecture.py`'s drawing vocabulary rather than re-deriving the
excalidraw wire format: same palette, same `card`/`zone`/`wire` helpers, same
bound-arrow validation. That module keeps its elements in module-level lists, so
this one clears them first and then builds its own scene — importing it is safe
because its `build()` only runs under `__main__`.

HONESTY IS A DRAWING RULE HERE. Solid stroke is working today; dashed is built
but not deployed or not wired; red is a gap stated in words. A diagram that
flatters the system is the one a reviewer catches, so `PolicyWallet` undeployed,
`moved_usdc` 0 and the unbuilt Discovery source are all on the page.
